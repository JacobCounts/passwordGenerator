# Password Generator

I found this very challenging, but after hours of research I was 
albe to make somthing that I am fairly happy with.
There are additional things to add eventually.

## Code Example

I decide to go with the CharCode instead of just inputing characters.

```function getRandomUpperCase(){
return String.fromCharCode(Math.floor(Math.random()*26)+65);
}
```

## How To Use

Upon clicking the generate button and random password will be produced
in the window using the desired paramaters selected.
